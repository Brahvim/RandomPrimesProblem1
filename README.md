# `RandomPrimesProblem1`!

...So I'm making this README *a bit too personal*, but I... *overslept during the day* (...a-as usual, for when I *do* sleep during the day, which I- *Tsk* I don't do it much, okay?! Very few days!), ...and woke up at 7 PM.

Apparently, at exactly 4 PM (3 hours ago! When I had *literally started* sleeping! Haha!...), a friend sent me a CS problem on WhatsApp.  
Here are the two messages he sent (sorry that I wasn't bothered to rewrite them ðŸ˜…):  

## *First message:*  
"""  
i need help in programming  
Can you  

Question is  
take input from user and check whether the no. is haning no.( The no. which are positive even no. whose prime factor includes 2, 3, 5 only. )

Example  
n=6  
6=2*3

n=90  
90=2*3*3*5

n=44  
44=2*2*11 ( Not a haning no. )  
"""

## *Second message:*  
"""  
plz don't solve this problem by ( return statement)  
"""

## ...

I worked till 1 in the night and then another 2 hours in the morning to solve it ._.  
***Too slow!*** ..I know, real computer scientists reading this!  
(PS *Some online friends had me talking,* ...uhh, I haven't been on Discord for months, lately - that's why!)  
(I can't stay awake. *I don't risk my sleep.*)  
But it worked! And I had *at least two* **actual** solutions.  
I was trying to optimize the code and 'making discoveries' all this time! Haha...

*Here are some links ta' help you out!:*
- [The final version I wrote](https://github.com/Brahvim/RandomPrimesProblem1/blob/main/src/com/brahvim/tanishq_primes_problem/App.java), and,  
- [The version I sent him](https://github.com/Brahvim/RandomPrimesProblem1/blob/no-return/src/com/brahvim/tanishq_primes_problem/App.java), which does not use returns, as per the problem's requirement (thank C!).
